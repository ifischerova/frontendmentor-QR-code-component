## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I hope that I understood the basic usage of the flexbox and tried to use media query to make a responsive component.

#### My learning notes from this challenge + feedback from the community
- I do not need to use media queries if the flexbox is used.
- Flexbox is the easiest way for positioning of the elements.
- Rem, vh, vw should be easier to use instead of pixels and makes the things responsive more easier, too.
- Height on body was changed to min-height with 100vh so it can grow. 
- Width on card was changed to max-width and rem were used.
- Width of the image was changed to max-width because the max-width on the card will stopi it if needed.
- Height was removed on the card completely because it will be dictated automatically by the browser.

### Continued development

This is my almost first project where I used flexbox and tried to make something responsive etc on my own. 
I really need to better understand and especially practise how to achieve responsive layout. 

### Useful resources

- [Vzhuru dolu](https://www.vzhurudolu.cz) - This great Czech source helped me with the orientation in the different attitudes to the responsive layout. It is a great and really reliable source for understanding the the whole process of creating websites.
They also focus on the news in this field and provide really great workshops and learnings. 
- [Can I use](https://www.caniuse.com) - If you need to check if some property is supported in the browser and how much.
